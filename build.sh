# SC_PATH defaults to the 3.14.1 worktree (plugin ABI / sc_api_version v3), which is
# loadable in the installed SuperCollider 3.14.x / 3.12.x apps. Point it at a develop
# checkout only if you run a scsynth built from develop (ABI v6). Installs into the user
# SuperCollider Extensions folder (see CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX in CMakeLists.txt).
